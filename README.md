# Web to Plex

This Chrome extension adds a Plex button on [Movieo](http://movieo.me/), [IMDb](http://imdb.com/) and [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) pages, letting you immediately open the movie or TV show on Plex Web if it is available.

Optionally you can configure CouchPotato in the options. After that, you can immediately add a movie to CouchPotato, with one click, right from Movieo, IMDb or Trakt.tv.
