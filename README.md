# Web to Plex

This Chrome extension adds a Plex button on [Movieo](http://movieo.me/), [IMDb](http://imdb.com/) and [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/) movie pages, letting you immediately open the movie on Plex Web if it is available.

Optionally you can configure CouchPotato in the options. After that, you can immediately add a movie to CouchPotato, with one click, right from Movieo, IMDb or Trakt.tv.

## Install

**Download on [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/movieo-to-plex/kmcinnefmnkfnmnmijfmbiaflncfifcn).**

A FireFox port is [in progress](https://github.com/SpaceK33z/web-to-plex/issues/5).

## Usage

Before using the extension, you need to configure it in the Options page (go to `chrome://extensions` and click on Options next to the extension).

It is somewhat difficult to configure, but everything should be explained well. Please don't hesitate to [submit an issue](https://github.com/SpaceK33z/web-to-plex/issues/new) if the configuration is unclear.
